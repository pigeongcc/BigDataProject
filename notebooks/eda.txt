1. users table is useless as it contains false vote_count value
  drop users with low real vote_count value

2. drop films with low real vote_count value

3. there are a lot of movies that has no movie features

    - 2164: only movie_id and some reviews (257 at max)
      since they have no features, it's reasonable to exclude them from the dataset.

4. movies genres distribution
    
5. Let us divide the movie features into three groups:

    the most important features for movie RecSys: 
                    'genres', 'original_language', 'overview',
                    'popularity', 'spoken_languages', 'vote_average', 'year_released'

    features that may be useful:
                    'production_countries', 'vote_count',
                    'movie_title' (если понравились Шрэк, Шрэк 2 - есть смысл порекомендовать Шрэк 3)

    probably useless features:
                    'runtime', 'release_date'
