1. users table is useless as it contains false info about number of reviews
    
2. Let us divide the movie features into three groups:

    the most important features for movie RecSys: 
                    'genres', 'original_language', 'overview',
                    'popularity', 'spoken_languages', 'vote_average', 'year_released'

    features that may be useful:
                    'production_countries', 'vote_count',
                    'movie_title' (если понравились Шрэк, Шрэк 2 - есть смысл порекомендовать Шрэк 3)

    probably useless features:
                    'runtime', 'release_date'

3. there are a lot of movies that has no movie features

    - 2164: only movie_id (257 reviews at max)

    they have only movie_id, and some (on average ) reviews
    since they have no features, it's reasonable to exclude them from the dataset.
